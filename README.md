# FT-Test

This repository contains the solution for the FT Customer Products technical exercise.

**#Description:**
The JavaScript Package is inside index.js file. This package is handling the errors and as a dependency node fecth is used. I have followed JS doc standard.

The below steps should be followed to use and test this package:

Steps:

1. You will have to download the code first and go to test-doc folder.
2. Open the terminal in your system and navigate to the test-doc folder. You can refer the follwing screenshot.

3. Type **node test.js** to view the output. Please refer the following screen shot.

Or you can test the package directly from index.js file of NPM_MULTIPLEURL_PACKAGE folder. For that you need to uncomment the lines 2-5 and 34.

Or if you are using VS Code as editor you can directly see the output in the terminal by running test.js.

Thank you.
